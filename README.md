# WordLete

## Introduction

WordLete is an word completion game that is played between 2 or more players. The objective of the game is to start with a random character (chosen by the app) and try to think of the longest word starting with it. The game starts by the first player adding the second character of the word he/she chose to the text box. The challenge of the game is that the second player cannot enter the same character as the first player. This is the same for each of the turns. 

The winner is chosen at the end by checking who had the longest dictionary word among all the players. This game aims to develop vocabulary and improve knowledge of words.

## Fixes and Features Planned for Version 1.1 and Beyond

* Version 1.0 contains a subset of the dictionary chosen online and contains most but not all of the English words in the dictionary. We aim to develop this dictionary to match the English dictionary. 

* Layout support is currently set to Android 12 and above, which doesn't have support for complex UI design and additional styling. We aim to fix this by removing support for legacy Android phones

* Currently this game supports only one user who plays against a computer player. Additional users support will be added
