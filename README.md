# Applied_CS_CodeSprint
This is a game for the Google Applied CS activity - Code Sprint

This is a project for the Code Sprint in the Google Applied CS workshop. We have developed a code for the "Wordlete" Game. 

We have used the following data structures for the game:

Trie - For saving the words
HashMap for efficient retrieval
PrioirtyQueue - for getting the word with max length
