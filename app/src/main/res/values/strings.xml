    <string name="ins">Wordlete plays with you to test your vocabulary!\n1. You and Wordlete will first be given an alphabet\n2. Think of a dictionary word starting with the alphabet\n3. Enter one letter at a time till you have letters left to guess\n4. Wordlete will do the same but it will not choose a letter you chose last\n(Remember, you could use this to spoof Wordlete!)\n5. You will win only by adding letters that lead to a dictionary word\n6. When prompted, enter the full word you thought.\n7. If Wordlete enters a longer word, it wins; else, you win!\n\n                  Good Luck!"</string>
